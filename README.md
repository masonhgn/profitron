# Trading Engine

This is a summer project I've started so I could become more familiar with quantitative finance / algorithmic trading. It's my first real attempt at creating a fully functioning, automated trading project so there will be difficulties as I am not using any singular guideline, just whatever books and free resources I find. At the bottom I will include sources to books that I found most helpful in creating this.

This project is, in essence, a small library of tools meant to gather financial data and provide meaningful information about that financial data, including trading signals and also automated tools to make those trades. Here is a list of API's used:

1. Yahoo Finance API (for gathering financial data, prices, historical data, etc.)
2. Tradier Brokerage API (for actually making the trades, this is connected to a Tradier brokerage account)


### Directory Structure

- core:
	contains main files for the project, specifically Engine.py which is the main file.

- trading_strategies:
	contains the all trading strategies. These are classes that inherit the TradingStrategy class.

- data_collection:
	contains files meant for collecting data. for now they just collect lists of securities that fit specific criteria.

- data:
	contains txt files generated by the files in data_collection directory.
